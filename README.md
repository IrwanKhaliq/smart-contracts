### Study Case

Develop a simple deposit DApp on Solidity with requirements as such:

1. Users may deposit cryptocurrency(e.g. ETH) into a smart contract.

2. The minimum number of deposits is 0.1 ether.

3. Users can see their current deposited balance.

4. The contract has a counter for each user that he/she may call to increment.

5. Users can only withdraw their deposited token after the value of his/her counter is above 10.

6. An address can not withdraw other&#39;s deposited tokens.

Create and post a GitHub repository that contains:

- Smart contracts

* DApp front end

* Contract&#39;s unit tests

* Installation manual

*Optional
